    "The Black-Scholes model (also known as the Black-Scholes-Merton model) is a Nobel Prize winning mathematical model describing financial markets containing derivative products. Using this model we can obtain the Black-Scholes formula which can be used to accurately price Eurpoean-style option contracts. By the end of this report we will have discussed the Black-Scholes option pricing model extensively, including: an outline of the model including its limitations, a derivation of the Black-Scholes equation and hence formula, the different ways to apply it (i.e. Explicit or with Monte-Carlo) and how to code these models using Python. We will also discuss extensions to the Black-Scholes model and examine how to input these into Python before reaching the report's conclusion."

    "The Black-Scholes model is heavily theoretical and therefore not so applicable in real scenarios. The model itself is based on a number of assumptions that are not realistic, which is where we come across limitations of the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first assumption of this model is that stock price movements follow a Geometric Brownian Motion, meaning that potentially considerable price swings, which often occur in the real world, are ignored. This variation can cause options to be substantially mispriced under the Black Scholes model, but many argue that by using a variation of a Jump-Diffusion we can extend the model to account for such swings (see Extension 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Secondly, the model also assumes that the underlying asset the contract is written on does not pay dividends, which disregards the impact that dividends have on the change in option valuations. This has been later fixed by extending the model, by subtracting the discounted value of a future dividend from stock prices. (see Extension 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Another assumption is that of constant volatility of the underlying asset price process and constant risk-free rate of return. These values are highly unlikely to remain constant in the real world, which brings the model into disrepute.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Under the rules of the Black-Scholes world, a significant assumption is that there are no transaction costs to buy and sell the options. While this is not yet feasible in the real world, as stock brokers charge for their services, transaction costs are decreasing steadily due to competition between financial institutions (see articles on Charles Schwab zero-fee trading, 2019). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, while the BS model is the only close form solution for pricing European options, it is not suitable for pricing American-style options. This is because in order to follow this theory, we assume that options do not allow for early exercise - a prominent feature of American-style options.\n",

    "To conclude this report, the Black-Scholes model offers an ingenious solution to the problem of pricing options contracts, but it is not without faults. Due to its multiple unrealistic assumptions, the model fails to wholly replicate reality and hence does not give a true and fair value of these contracts. In reality, we use Monte-Carlo simulations to estimate the movements in stock prices via random sampling, but in order to improve upon the actual theory we must extend it to tackle its unrealistic assumptions. We examined two of these extensions in detil above, but other possible extensions include: implied volatility, asian options and the volatility smile. With the many developments built upon the 1973 theory, option pricing is now more comprehensive and accurate than ever before."
